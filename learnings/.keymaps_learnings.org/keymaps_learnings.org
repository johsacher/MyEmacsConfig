keymaps background process seems (unfortunately) a bit complex. Here is how "it works" and "what that means" for straight forward key-binding definitions, especially for minor-mode specific evil-key-bindings:

* questions:
** QUESTION global-map <--> "major-mode-map" (does it even exist?)
** QUESTION minor mode map
** QUESTION global set key
** QUESTION local set key
** QUESTION how does evil-define-key integrate into all of this
* the emacs documentation is BAD...
** e.g.

â€” Variable: global-map

    This variable contains the default global keymap that maps Emacs keyboard input to commands. The global keymap is normally this keymap. The default global keymap is a full keymap that binds self-insert-command to all of the printing characters.

    It is normal practice to change the bindings in the global keymap, but you should not assign this variable any value other than the keymap it starts out with. 
** --> what??? what is even the "global map"? 
* The Emacs background "key binding" process, in simple words:
** key background data structure: /keymaps/, like so: (<name of map> <keybinding1> <keybinding2> etc.)
** most important thing: emacs has a *hierarchical* look up process within the active keymaps. the following are the practically important ones (in that order) during "key lookup process":
(https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/mastering-key-bindings-emacs)
*** emulation-mode-map-alists
*** minor-mode-overriding-map-alist
*** minor-mode-map-alist
*** current-local-map (function) / local-map (variable, nearly always the same)
**** manipulate with: (local-set-key <key> <function>)
*** current-global-map (function) / (local-map (variable, nearly always the same)
**** manipulate with: (global-set-key <key> <function>)
* how does evil-mode play along with emacs' mode-map system:
** evil-mode (global minor mode) sets up a evil-local-mode in each buffer, which takes care of all keybindings 
*** good description in evil-core.el:
[...]
Evil is defined as a globalized minor mode, enabled with the toggle function `evil-mode'.  This in turn enables `evil-local-mode' in every buffer, which sets up the buffer's state.

Each state has its own keymaps, and these keymaps have status as "emulation keymaps" with priority over regular keymaps.  Emacs maintains the following keymap hierarchy (highest priority first):
    * Overriding keymaps/overlay keymaps...
    * Emulation mode keymaps...
      - Evil keymaps...
    * Minor mode keymaps...
    * Local keymap (`local-set-key')
    * Global keymap (`global-set-key')

Within this hierarchy, Evil arranges the keymaps for *the current state* as shown below:

    * Intercept keymaps...
    * Local state keymap
    * Minor-mode keymaps...
    * Auxiliary keymaps...
    * Overriding keymaps...
    * Global state keymap
    * Keymaps for other states...
