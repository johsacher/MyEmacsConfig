* best debugging work flow i found: using 'edebug' (not the standard 'debugger')
** steps:
*** 'instrument' function (whatever that means...):
**** go to function body and type C-u C-M-x (i know this is cryptic, currently did not find another way..)
*** then execute the function
*** *change to Emacs-mode* in case you use evil-mode
*** proceed 'next' by pressing 'n'
