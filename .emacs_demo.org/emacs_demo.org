* what is Emacs?
** me: "emacs is not a text-editor. emacs is a text-based interface-platform, to automize your work flow."
** thus ANY text-editing style can be plugged-in (vim-style, emacs-style, etc.)
** everything is a function. every function can be called via customized short cut. --> everything can be done via short-cut.

* latex (auctex)
** 'C-=' -> cool navigation in pop-up toc, also multi-file-document 

* the vim text editing language
** Emacs cannot be compared to VIM, but the VIM text editing system can be used inside Emacs
*** VIM is more a concept for short-cut-design for text-editing
*** since in emacs short cuts are fully customizable, using VIM in Emacs just means redefining the default short-cuts the "VIM-way"
** why the VIM short-cut system is awesome - demo of cool work flow features:
*** navigate h,j,k,l
*** modal editing -> no pain of ctrl-/alt-key-combinations
** goodies:
*** "electric" indentation
mark region and hit "=="
*** mark just pasted region "SPC-v"
*** jump to corresponding bracket "%"
