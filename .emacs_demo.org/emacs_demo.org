* me: "emacs in not a text-editor. emacs is a text-based interface-platform, to automize your work flow."
* thus ANY text-editing style can be plugged-in (vim-style, emacs-style, etc.)
* everything is a function. every function can be called via customized short cut. --> everything can be done via short-cut.
